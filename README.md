‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup Instructions
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend/ directory.

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configure .env: Create a file named .env in the backend/ folder and add your local MongoDB URI and port:

PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/blogapi

Start the server:

node server.js

(The console should confirm "Connected to MongoDB successfully!")

2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend/ directory.

cd ../frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the React development server:

npm run dev

The React client will open, and the GET /posts request will automatically connect to your local backend server at http://localhost:3000/posts.
